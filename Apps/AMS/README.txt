General Information

     This is ams version 1.3.0. The ams application allows users to design,
   run and evaluate auditory models. It allows users to run and evaluate
   auditory models writing using development system for auditory modelling
   (DSAM) simulation scripts. DSAM provides access to an extensive collection
   of published and new models and analysis and utility functions.

    There are two executable files, which are fully operational, however the
   help documentation is not yet complete.

    The ams executable will run the application version with graphics
   support. The ams_ng application is the console version.

    The main parameter file for both executables is the 'ams.par' ASCII text
   file, though ams will work without this file. The driving DSAM simulation
   specification file is specified in the 'ams.par' file, among other
   parameters.

    To use this application on UNIX the DSAM library must be installed.

Installation

    Windows self-extracting installations require no additional
   configuration.

    Under Linux/Unix systems the autoconf auto-configuration system is used
   if no ready-compiled installation is available. Linux/Unix users needing
   to compile ams should refer to the file 'INSTALL' for further information.

DSAM Library Documentation & Supporting DSAM

    If you find ams useful you can help provide support for the project by
   purchasing the DSAM Library Documentation. DSAM Library Documentation is
   the definitive guide to using the development system for auditory
   modelling (DSAM). It provides the missing documentation to realize the
   full potential of running simulations using DSAM, including example
   scripts and parameter settings showing how to use each module.

    Links to the DSAM Library Documentation can be found from the DSAM
   website: Follow the "Documentation links."

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version Numbering

    The primary ams version information (i.e. "1.3.0") consists of three
   numbers separated by a period (full stop):

    <major number>.<minor number>.<revision>

    The major number is increased when there are significant jumps in
   functionality, the minor number is incremented when only minor features or
   significant fixes have been added, and the revision number is incremented
   when minor bugs are fixed. Self-extracting installations such as for
   windows or Linux RPM or Debian packages will have an additional version
   number, which describes changes in the installation configuration rather
   than the application itself.

How to report bugs

    To report a bug, send mail either to the dsam list, as mentioned above.
   In the mail include:

     *   An SPF file produced using ams.

     *   Information about your system. For instance:

          * What operating system and version

          * What version of X

          * What version of the C library (Linux)

       - and anything else you think is relevant.

     *   How to reproduce the bug.

     * If the bug was a crash, the exact text that was printed out when the
       crash occured.

     * Further information such as stack traces may be useful, but is not
       necessary.

#		ANA_FourierT				< Fourier.par

# computes a Fourier transform of a signal
# resolution is a function of the total number 
#  of points in the signal.

# Warning the ANA_Fourier generates a mirror image
#  of the power spectrum.  However, negative 
#  frequencies are not displayed.
# Results are best read only in the first/left half of the output.

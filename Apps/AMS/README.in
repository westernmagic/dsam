General Information
===================

This is @PACKAGE@ version @VERSION@.  @PACKAGE@ allows users to
design, run and evaluate auditory models.  It is supported by the
extensive collection of published and new models supplied by the
development system for auditory modelling (DSAM).

There are two executable files, which are fully operational,
however the help documentation is not yet complete.

The AMS executable will run the application version with graphics
support. The AMS_NG application is the console version.

The main parameter file for both executables is the 'AMS.par' ASCII
text file, though AMS will work without this file. The driving DSAM
simulation specification file is specified in the 'AMS.par' file,
among other parameters.

To use this application on UNIX the DSAM library must be installed.

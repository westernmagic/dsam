<sect1><title>General Information</title>
<para>

This is @PACKAGE@ version @VERSION@.  The @PACKAGE@ application allows users to
design, run and evaluate auditory models. It allows users to run and
evaluate auditory models writing using development system for
auditory modelling (DSAM) simulation scripts. DSAM provides access to
an extensive collection of published and new models and analysis and utility
functions.
</para>

<para>
There are two executable files, which are fully operational,
however the help documentation is not yet complete.
</para>

<para>
The @PACKAGE@ executable will run the application version with graphics
support. The @PACKAGE@_ng application is the console version.
</para>

<para>
The main parameter file for both executables is the '@PACKAGE@.par' ASCII
text file, though @PACKAGE@ will work without this file. The driving DSAM
simulation specification file is specified in the '@PACKAGE@.par' file,
among other parameters.
</para>

<para>
To use this application on UNIX the DSAM library must be installed.
</para>

<sect1><title>Installation</title>

<para>
Windows self-extracting installations require no additional configuration.
</para>

<para>
Under Linux/Unix systems the autoconf auto-configuration system is used if 
no ready-compiled installation is available.  Linux/Unix users needing to compile
@PACKAGE@ should refer to the file 'INSTALL' for further information.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1><title>DSAM Library Documentation &amp; Supporting DSAM</title>

<para>
If you find @PACKAGE@ useful you can help provide support for the project by
purchasing the DSAM Library Documentation.  DSAM Library Documentation is the
definitive guide to using the development system for auditory modelling (DSAM).
It provides the missing documentation to realize the full potential of running
simulations using DSAM, including example scripts and parameter settings showing
how to use each module.
</para>

<para>
Links to the DSAM Library Documentation can be found from the DSAM website: Follow
the "Documentation links."
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1><title>Version Numbering</title>

<para>
The primary @PACKAGE@ version information (i.e. "@VERSION@") consists of three numbers
separated by a period (full stop):
</para>

<para>
&lt;major number&gt;.&lt;minor number&gt;.&lt;revision&gt;
</para>

<para>
The major number is increased when there are significant jumps in functionality,
the minor number is incremented when only minor features or significant fixes have been
added, and the revision number is incremented when minor bugs are fixed.
Self-extracting installations such as for windows or Linux RPM or Debian packages will have an
additional version number, which describes changes in the installation configuration
rather than the application itself.
</para>

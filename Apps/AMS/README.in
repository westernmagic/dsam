General Information
===================

This is @PACKAGE@ version @VERSION@.  @PACKAGE@ is a library to support
programmers producing auditory models.  It includes a wide collection of
established and experimental auditory models.  It also provides facilities for
reading and writing to sound file formats, in addition to including many
analysis functions.

To use the graphics support code, the wxWin code must be obtained and compiled

The wxUSE_APPLE_IEEE must be set to 0 (Note to Lowel: If this approach does not
work, then move the UtUIEEEFloat.c to the standard, Std library, and the Gr..
library so that the alternative compiled code - with and without the duplicated
IEEE conversion routines - can be used as necessary).

How to report bugs
==================

To report a bug, send mail either to gtk-list, as mentioned
above, or to gtk-bugs@gtk.org. If you send mail to gtk-list, you
must be subscribed yourself.

In the mail include:

* The version of GLib

* Information about your system. For instance:

   - What operating system and version
   - What version of X
   - For Linux, what version of the C library

  And anything else you think is relevant.

* How to reproduce the bug. 

  If you can reproduce it with the testglib program that is built 
  in the glib/ directory, that will be most convenient.  Otherwise, 
  please include a short test program that exhibits the behavior. 
  As a last resort, you can also provide a pointer to a larger piece 
  of software that can be downloaded.

* If the bug was a crash, the exact text that was printed out
  when the crash occured.

* Further information such as stack traces may be useful, but
  is not necessary.

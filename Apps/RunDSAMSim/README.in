<sect1><title>General Information</title>
<para>
This is @PACKAGE@ version @VERSION@.  The @PACKAGE@ application provides an
interface to Matlab(tm) (also Octave and java) which allows users to run and evaluate
auditory models writing using development system for auditory modelling (DSAM)
simulation scripts. DSAM provides access to an extensive collection of published
and new models, as well as a wide variety of analysis and utility functions.
</para>

<para>
The @PACKAGE@ currently has two interfaces which provide direct access to
DSAM simulations: (1) "RunDSAMSimJ" - java interface and (2) The "RunDSAMSim.mex"
mex file.
</para>
<para>
The "RunDSAMSimJ" java interface has been tested with Matlab 2007b, 2009a and
should work with any version of Matlab.  It uses a java application which is
supported by a dynamic link library.  Octave users should use the original
RunDSAMSim.mex interface as octave currently has no java support.
</para>

<para>
A python interface is also under consideration.
</para>

<para>
To use this application on UNIX the DSAM library must be installed.

</sect1>

<sect1><title>Installation</title>

<para>
Windows self-extracting installations require no additional configuration.
</para>

<para>
Under Linux/Unix systems the autoconf auto-configuration system is used if 
no ready-compiled installation is available.  Linux/Unix users needing to compile
@PACKAGE@ should refer to the file 'INSTALL' for further information.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1><title>Matlab Configuration</title>

<para>
Two matlab configuration files need to be edited: "classpath.txt" and
"librarypath.txt".   Usually the path is "&lt;matlab installation
directory&gt;\toolbox\local", alternatively the path to these files can be found
by starting matlab and issuing the commands "edit classpath.txt" and "edit
librarypath.txt". On most installations this will open the files and the file
path will be shown in the editor window title.
</para>

<para>
Usually these files will require special privileges in order to
make changes to them. On Windows Vista, open the Notepad text editor with
administrator privileges, i.e. "start menu"->"Accessories", right-click on
the "Notepad" application to open the dialog window and choose "Run as administrator".
</para>

<para>
On Linux/Unix systems super user access will be required, i.e. using "sudo" or
"su".  Your may need to get your system administrator to do this configuration
if you do not have sufficient privileges on your system.
</para>

<sect2><title>Changes to classpath.txt</title>

<para>
Append the full path to the <emphasis>jar</emphasis> file.  For default
installations the added line should look as follows for Windows Vista:
</para>

<para>
c:\Program Files\Common Files\dsam\RunDSAMSimjni-@VERSION@.jar
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2><title>Changes to librarypath.txt</title>

<para>
Append the full path to the support files for the package.  For default
installations the added line should read as follows for Windows Vista:
</para>

<para>
C:\Program Files\Common Files\dsam
</para>

</sect2>

</sect1>

<sect1><title>Testing/Examples</title>

<para>
Start Matlab and change the current directory to the <emphasis>Examples</emphasis>
directory.  On default Windows installations this directory will be found in the
directory <emphasis>C:\Program Files\DSAM Applications\RunDSAMSim"</emphasis>.
</para>

<para>
Run the <emphasis>MatlabDemoRunDSAMSim.m</emphasis> script using the command:
</para>

<para>
>> MatlabDemoRunDSAMSim([1 2], 'java');
</para>

<para>
On an Intel(R) Core (TM) Duo 2.33 GHz system this takes approximately 3 minutes to run.
The demonstration calculates the post-stimulus time histogram and rate-intensity
curves for a model VCN Onset-C cell. 
</para>

<para>
You can make a copy of the <emphasis>Examples</emphasis> directory to use as the
basis of your own code.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1><title>DSAM Library Documentation &amp; Supporting DSAM</title>

<para>
If you find @PACKAGE@ useful you can help provide support for the project by
purchasing the DSAM Library Documentation.  DSAM Library Documentation is the
definitive guide to using the development system for auditory modelling (DSAM).
It provides the missing documentation to realize the full potential of running
simulations using DSAM, including example scripts and parameter settings showing
how to use each module.
</para>

<para>
Links to the DSAM Library Documentation can be found from the DSAM website: Follow
the "Documentation links."
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1><title>Version Numbering</title>

<para>
The primary @PACKAGE@ version information (i.e. "@VERSION@") consists of three numbers
separated by a period (full stop):
</para>

<para>
&lt;major number&gt;.&lt;minor number&gt;.&lt;revision&gt;
</para>

<para>
The major number is increased when there are significant jumps in functionality,
the minor number is incremented when only minor features or significant fixes have been
added, and the revision number is incremented when minor bugs are fixed.
Self-extracting installations such as for windows or Linux RPM or Debian packages will have an
additional version number, which describes changes in the installation configuration
rather than the application itself.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1><title>How to report bugs</title>

<para>
To report a bug, send mail either to the dsam list, as mentioned
above.  In the mail include:
</para>

	The version of @PACKAGE@
	</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
	<para>
	A directory containing all of the files - DSAM and matlab scripts - to reproduce the 
	problem.

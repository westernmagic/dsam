Description: Run and evaluate auditory models
 The rundsamsim application provides interfaces to Matlab(tm), via Java;
 Python and also Octave. The interfaces allow users to run and evaluate
 auditory models written using development system for auditory modelling
 (DSAM) simulation scripts. DSAM provides access to an extensive collection
 of published and other auditory models, as well as a wide variety of
 analysis and utility functions. Examples scripts showing how the interfaces
 can be used are included in the installation.
